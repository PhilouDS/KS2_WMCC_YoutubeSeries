The crafts folder contains the crafts from my game. You can copy them in:
[USER]\AppData\LocalLow\Intercept Games\Kerbal Space Program 2\Saves\SinglePlayer\[SAVE NAME]\Workspaces

The other folder contains my to2 scripts. You can copy them in:
[KSP2 install folder]\BepInEx\plugins\KontrolSystem2\to2Local

There are all free to use. You can modify and share it (though acknowledging the source will be nice ^^).
